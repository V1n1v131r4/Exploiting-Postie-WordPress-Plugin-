# Exploiting Postie WordPress Plugin

This PoC describe how to exploit Postie WordPress plugin v1.9.40

### About Postie WordPress plugin

### Spoofing valid user for post submission

Postie only allows posting of articles submitted by authorized users through a mailing list registered in the plugin settings.
However through the email sender's spoofing technique it was possible to bypass the plugin settings and publish a post as having been sent by a valid user, as shown in the images below.

### XSS with JavaScript Polyglot

Another way to exploit the Postie plugin was a Cross-Site Script (XSS) attack using Polyglot JavaScript syntax, as follows:

`jaVasCript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`

The above syntax can be explained as follows:

* `jaVasCript`:: A label in ECMAScript; a URI scheme otherwise.
* `/-//*\/'/"/**/`: A multi-line comment in ECMAScript; a literal-breaker sequence.
* `(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )`: A tangled execution zone wrapped in invoking parenthesis!
* `//%0D%0A%0d%0a//`: A single-line comment in ECMAScript; a double-CRLF in HTTP response headers.
* `:` A sneaky HTML-tag-breaker sequence.
* `\x3csVg/\x3e`: An innocuous svg element.
